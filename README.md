# Swift-Factorials

This is a swift function that calculates:

- Factorials [ **n!** ]
- Semi-factorials [ **n!!** ]
- Twice iterated factorials [ **(n!)!** ]

This function allows to obtain infinite numbers due to a function that performs multiplications using and returning Strings.



As each factorial increases exponentially, the time to calculate the next factorial increases exponentially as well.
